<h1>Our Beautiful Food Area</h1>
<p>Food service spaces are increasingly becoming extensions of the classroom. They provide a pleasant environment for social interaction that promotes collaborative learning, with the added benefit of being able to grab a bite to eat. To facilitate this important function, the space should include WiFi and furniture with built-in outlets that bring power from the floor to the work surface.

Living Room Extension

Itâ€™s a mistake to design a space for students to sit and eat. Students visit food service spaces to eat and talk, eat and read, eat and check email. One student might stop in between classes for a coffee and to review her lesson plan before an exam. A group of students may gather mid-afternoon to collaborate on a project. </p>

<h1>Our Beautiful Nescafe Area</h1>
<p>Keeping high college students on campus where they can be properly supervised is often a challenge. Offering their favorite caffeinated beverages in-house is one way to meet that challenge, especially for college that have open campuses where students are permitted to leave. As many college remove soda and vending machines from college grounds, replacing them with a coffee bar can be a great alternative, giving students an off-campus type of experience inside the college.
By setting up and running a coffee stand, students can actually benefit from hands-on learning during their business classes. If they re working in conjunction with the school nutrition department, even better! All parties benefit when a coffee cart draws more students into the school cafeteria.</p>

<h1>Our Beautiful Juice Area</h1>
<p>Juicing is no healthier than eating whole fruits and vegetables.

Juicing extracts the juice from fresh fruits or vegetables. The liquid contains most of the vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals (phytonutrients) found in the fruit. However, whole fruits and vegetables also have healthy fiber, which is lost during most juicing.

Some believe that juicing is better than eating whole fruits and vegetables because your body can absorb the nutrients better and it gives your digestive system a rest from digesting fiber. They say juicing can reduce your risk of cancer, boost your immune system, remove toxins from your body, aid digestion and help you lose weight.

However, there no scientific evidence that extracted juices are healthier than the juice you get by eating the fruit or vegetable itself.
